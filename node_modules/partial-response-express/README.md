# partial-response

A fork from express-partial-response which ignores a querystring field filter whenever an error occurs

## Why ?

The package [express-partial-response](https://github.com/nemtsov/express-partial-response) doesn't have  support to ignore filter whenever an error occurs in application and this library comes to solve the problem.

## Usage 

See the [express-partial-response](https://github.com/nemtsov/express-partial-response) page and learn how to use it.
